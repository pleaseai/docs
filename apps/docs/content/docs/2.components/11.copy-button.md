# CopyButton

A button component that copies text to the clipboard when clicked, providing visual feedback on success.

## Usage

The CopyButton is primarily used internally by the ProsePre component to provide copy functionality for code blocks. It can also be used standalone:

```mdc
::copy-button{value="npm install @pleaseai/docs"}
::
```

## How It Works

1. User clicks the copy button
2. The `value` prop content is copied to the clipboard
3. The icon changes from a copy icon to a check icon
4. After a brief delay, the icon returns to the copy state

## In Code Blocks

CopyButton is automatically included in all fenced code blocks. When you write:

```ts
const hello = "world"
```

A copy button appears in the top-right corner of the code block.

## Props

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|------|------|---------|-------------|
| `value` | `string` | `''` | Text content to copy to clipboard |
| `class` | `string` | - | Additional CSS classes |

## Styling

The button displays:
- Copy icon (clipboard) in default state
- Check icon when content has been copied
- Positioned absolutely (typically top-right of parent)
- Subtle hover effect
